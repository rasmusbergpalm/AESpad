## AESpad ##
AESpad is released under the GNU General Public License version 3.

AESpad is a secure hosted chat that uses the tried and tested AES encryption algorithm to encrypt messages.
AESpad relies on a pre-shared key among chat participants.
The messages are encrypted using an AES javascript implementation before they are sent to the server.
The key never leaves the client.
